# The Gender Wage Gap
This repository contains the final project for WRIT 105M (Multimedia Writing) taken at UCSB. Students conduct an in-depth analysis on a topic of their choosing, applying course concepts such as research, writing, and multimedia design. 

My project centers on the gender wage gap and seeks to examine its persistent nature. To this end, I survey the existing body of research, analyze its key determinants, and present a detailed report of my findings.   

## Project Description 
This project consolidates data from multiple official sources to explore key drivers of the gender wage gap, integrating research, analysis, and design elements for impact and clarity.

Visualizations come from organizations such as the [Economic Policy Institute (EPI)](epi.gov) and the [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](bls.goc). Each figure will be accompanied by a caption and source attribution (APA 7th ed.). Design elements include infographics, embedded visuals, and summary slides. 

Mediums include Google Suite (Docs) for writing, Canva and Adobe Creative Suite for design, as well as reporting software such as Adobe Acrobat.Â 

## Project Roadmap 
This report begins by outlining the research question, defining its scope, and clarifying goals and limitations. It then provides a thorough background of the gender wage gap, followed by an analysis of its short- and long-term implications. Next, it assesses previous policy efforts before concluding with data-driven recommendations and reflections on methodology and future research directions. 

Throughout, data visualizations illustrate key trends and support the analysis.
